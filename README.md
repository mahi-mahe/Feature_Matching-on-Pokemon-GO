# Feature_Matching-on-Pokemon-GO
The projects demonstrate practicals on feature matching using SIFT, SURF and ORB detector on video game and chessboard images.
# Feature Descriptors – SIFT, ORB, SURF

This project demonstrates how popular feature descriptor algorithms work using OpenCV.  
Given an image, the program detects keypoints and visualizes them for SIFT, ORB, and (if available) SURF.

---

## What the code does

- Loads an input image  
- Converts it to grayscale  
- Detects keypoints and computes descriptors  
- Draws rich keypoints (scale + orientation)  
- Displays results for each method  

---

## Implemented Methods

- **SIFT** – accurate, scale & rotation invariant, float descriptors  
- **ORB** – fast, efficient, binary descriptors  
- **SURF** – may not be available in default OpenCV builds

## How to run

Update the image path and execute:
